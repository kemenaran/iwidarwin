=== I can check out from svn repository via http and anonymously but i cannot commit ==
you cannot commit your changing with http .
at first , you check out source code via https . (or change repository to https's) 
and you should edit source code.

your svn may not support https connection.
you should build svn from source code by hand or 
you should install unstable version with fink. ( it is automaticaly build )

you can use "svn merge".

{{{
  cd trunk/<somthing> 
  svn merge -r 15:18 ../braches/<somthing> 
}}}

if you merge branches's diff to trunk.
{{{
  cd braches/<somthing> 
  svn merge -r 20:25 ../trunk/<somthing> 
}}}
